1
00:01:52,197 --> 00:01:53,948
- Good morning.
- Good morning.

2
00:01:55,325 --> 00:02:01,706
Here ye, here ye, 10 minutes to go
till Van Dort's wedding rehearsal.

3
00:02:17,972 --> 00:02:19,390
Watch it!

4
00:02:27,649 --> 00:02:29,150
<i>It's a beautiful day.</i>

5
00:02:29,317 --> 00:02:30,485
<i>It's a rather nice day.</i>

6
00:02:30,652 --> 00:02:32,821
<i>A day for a glorious wedding.</i>

7
00:02:32,987 --> 00:02:35,740
<i>A rehearsal, my dear
To be perfectly clear.</i>

8
00:02:35,907 --> 00:02:38,326
<i>A rehearsal
for a glorious wedding.</i>

9
00:02:38,493 --> 00:02:41,412
<i>Assuming nothing happens
That we don't really know.</i>

10
00:02:41,579 --> 00:02:43,998
<i>That nothing unexpected
Interferes with the show.</i>

11
00:02:44,165 --> 00:02:46,584
<i>And that's why everything
Every last little thing.</i>

12
00:02:46,835 --> 00:02:51,589
<i>Every single, tiny, microscopic
Little thing must go.</i>

13
00:02:51,756 --> 00:02:54,634
- <i>According to plan.
- Our son will be married.</i>

14
00:02:54,801 --> 00:02:56,928
- <i>According to plan.
- Our family carried.</i>

15
00:02:57,095 --> 00:03:00,890
<i>Elevated to the heights
of society.</i>

16
00:03:01,182 --> 00:03:03,685
- <i>To the costume balls.
- In the hallowed halls.</i>

17
00:03:03,852 --> 00:03:06,020
<i>Rubbing elbows with the finest.</i>

18
00:03:06,187 --> 00:03:08,815
<i>Having crumpets
with Her Highness.</i>

19
00:03:09,274 --> 00:03:11,776
<i>We'll be there, we'll be seen
Having tea with the queen.</i>

20
00:03:11,943 --> 00:03:15,613
<i>We'll forget everything
That we've ever, ever been.</i>

21
00:03:17,615 --> 00:03:20,952
- Blimey! It's my dress is caught.
- Begging your pardon, ma'am.

22
00:03:21,119 --> 00:03:24,622
- Come on, dear.
- It's not me. It's my dress.

23
00:03:24,789 --> 00:03:27,625
Where is Victor?
We might be late.

24
00:03:32,463 --> 00:03:33,590
Fish merchants.

25
00:03:34,966 --> 00:03:37,635
- <i>It's a terrible day.
- Now, don't be that way.</i>

26
00:03:37,802 --> 00:03:40,346
<i>It's a terrible day
for a wedding.</i>

27
00:03:40,513 --> 00:03:43,516
<i>It's a sad, sad state
of affairs we're in.</i>

28
00:03:43,683 --> 00:03:46,895
<i>That has led to this
ominous wedding.</i>

29
00:03:47,061 --> 00:03:49,230
<i>How could our family
have come to this?</i>

30
00:03:49,898 --> 00:03:52,400
<i>To marry off our daughter
To the nouveau riche.</i>

31
00:03:52,567 --> 00:03:54,068
- <i>They're so common.
- So coarse.</i>

32
00:03:54,235 --> 00:03:58,031
- <i>Oh, it couldn't be worse.
- Couldn't be worse? I disagree.</i>

33
00:03:58,197 --> 00:04:00,867
<i>They could be land-rich,
Bankrupt aristocracy.</i>

34
00:04:01,034 --> 00:04:02,452
<i>Without a penny to their name.</i>

35
00:04:02,619 --> 00:04:05,997
<i>Just like you and me.</i>

36
00:04:06,164 --> 00:04:07,957
Oh, dear.

37
00:04:08,541 --> 00:04:11,419
<i>And that's why everything
Every last little thing.</i>

38
00:04:11,586 --> 00:04:16,341
<i>Every single, tiny, microscopic
Little thing must go.</i>

39
00:04:18,801 --> 00:04:21,596
- <i>According to plan.
- Our daughter will wed.</i>

40
00:04:21,763 --> 00:04:24,682
- <i>According to plan.
- Our family led.</i>

41
00:04:24,849 --> 00:04:29,646
<i>From the depths
of deepest poverty.</i>

42
00:04:30,563 --> 00:04:33,566
- <i>To the noble realm.
- Of our ancestry.</i>

43
00:04:33,733 --> 00:04:36,569
<i>And who would have guessed
In a million years.</i>

44
00:04:36,736 --> 00:04:39,948
- <i>That our daughter with a face.
- Of an otter in disgrace.</i>

45
00:04:40,114 --> 00:04:44,661
<i>Would provide our ticket
To a rightful place.</i>

46
00:04:51,167 --> 00:04:52,543
Oh, Hildegarde.

47
00:04:52,710 --> 00:04:55,880
What if Victor and I don't
like each other?

48
00:04:57,382 --> 00:04:59,968
As if that has anything
to do with marriage.

49
00:05:00,134 --> 00:05:03,763
Do you suppose your father
and I like each other?

50
00:05:03,930 --> 00:05:05,473
Surely you must a little?

51
00:05:06,224 --> 00:05:07,558
- Of course not.
- Of course not.

52
00:05:07,725 --> 00:05:09,686
Get those corsets
laced properly.

53
00:05:09,852 --> 00:05:12,730
I can hear you speak
without gasping.

54
00:05:19,070 --> 00:05:21,406
You've certainly hooked
a winner this time, Victor.

55
00:05:21,572 --> 00:05:25,326
- Now, all you have to do is reel her in.
- I'm already reeling, Mother.

56
00:05:25,493 --> 00:05:28,621
Shouldn't Victoria Everglot be
marrying a lord or something?

57
00:05:28,788 --> 00:05:32,125
Oh, nonsense! We're every bit
as good as the Everglots.

58
00:05:32,291 --> 00:05:36,671
I always knew I deserved better
than a fish merchant's life.

59
00:05:36,838 --> 00:05:39,132
But I've never
even spoken to her.

60
00:05:39,298 --> 00:05:41,926
Well, at least we have
that in our favor.

61
00:05:43,302 --> 00:05:46,097
Mayhew!
Silence that blasted coughing.

62
00:05:51,519 --> 00:05:55,106
Marriage is a partnership,
a little tit for tat.

63
00:05:55,606 --> 00:05:58,026
You'd think a lifetime
watching us...

64
00:05:58,192 --> 00:06:00,903
<i>Might have taught her that.</i>

65
00:06:01,070 --> 00:06:04,198
- <i>Might have taught her that.
- Everything must be perfect.</i>

66
00:06:04,365 --> 00:06:07,201
- <i>Everything must be perfect.
- Everything must be perfect.</i>

67
00:06:07,368 --> 00:06:09,037
<i>Perfect That's why everything.</i>

68
00:06:09,203 --> 00:06:10,621
<i>Every last little thing.</i>

69
00:06:10,788 --> 00:06:14,959
<i>Every single, tiny, microscopic
Little thing must go.</i>

70
00:06:15,126 --> 00:06:17,920
<i>According to plan.</i>

71
00:06:21,299 --> 00:06:22,800
Look at the way you're standing.

72
00:06:22,967 --> 00:06:25,720
You look like you got
rickets or something...

73
00:06:31,559 --> 00:06:33,394
Oh!

74
00:06:33,728 --> 00:06:39,484
Oh, my goodness. Oh, such grandeur!
Such impeccable taste!

75
00:06:39,650 --> 00:06:42,111
- Oh, beautiful, innit?
- Hmph.

76
00:06:43,654 --> 00:06:45,374
It's not as big
as our place, dear.

77
00:06:48,785 --> 00:06:51,162
- Bit shabby really, isn't it?
- Shut up.

78
00:06:51,329 --> 00:06:54,082
Lord and Lady Everglot...

79
00:06:54,248 --> 00:06:57,919
Mr. and Mrs. Van Dort.

80
00:06:58,086 --> 00:07:00,588
Why, you must be Miss Victoria.

81
00:07:01,214 --> 00:07:05,468
Yes, I must say, you don't look
a day over 20. No. Oh, yes.

82
00:07:06,511 --> 00:07:09,263
Smile, darling, smile.

83
00:07:13,851 --> 00:07:18,397
Well, hello. What a pleasure.
Welcome to our home.

84
00:07:18,940 --> 00:07:20,191
Oh, thank you.

85
00:07:20,358 --> 00:07:23,694
We'll be taking tea
in the west drawing room.

86
00:07:25,154 --> 00:07:27,698
Oh, do come this way,
it's just through there.

87
00:07:27,865 --> 00:07:32,120
Oh, I love what you've done with the place.
Who is your decorator?

88
00:07:32,286 --> 00:07:34,330
Nice tiles, shame
about the drapes.

89
00:07:34,497 --> 00:07:38,000
Oh, my husband says such foolish things.
Ignore him.

90
00:07:38,501 --> 00:07:40,503
Oh, yes, it's usually best.

91
00:09:09,008 --> 00:09:12,595
- Do forgive me.
- You play beautifully.

92
00:09:12,762 --> 00:09:18,017
I... I... I do apologize, Miss Everglot.
How rude of me to... Well...

93
00:09:18,768 --> 00:09:20,269
Excuse me.

94
00:09:22,188 --> 00:09:23,981
Mother won't let
me near the piano.

95
00:09:24,690 --> 00:09:27,985
Music is improper
for a young lady.

96
00:09:28,152 --> 00:09:29,695
Too passionate, she says.

97
00:09:29,862 --> 00:09:34,659
If I may ask, Miss Everglot...

98
00:09:34,825 --> 00:09:37,161
where is your chaperon?

99
00:09:37,662 --> 00:09:41,999
Perhaps, in... In view
of the circumstances...

100
00:09:42,583 --> 00:09:45,336
you could call me Victoria.

101
00:09:45,836 --> 00:09:47,505
Yes, of course. Well...

102
00:09:48,297 --> 00:09:51,717
- Victoria...
- Yes, Victor.

103
00:09:52,969 --> 00:09:55,638
Tomorrow, we are to be m...

104
00:09:57,223 --> 00:09:58,557
M... M...

105
00:09:59,016 --> 00:10:03,145
- Married.
- Yes. Ha. Married.

106
00:10:04,563 --> 00:10:08,651
Since I was a child, I've...
I've dreamt of my wedding day.

107
00:10:09,235 --> 00:10:12,196
I always hoped to find someone
I was deeply in love with.

108
00:10:12,697 --> 00:10:15,533
Someone to spend the rest
of my life with.

109
00:10:16,075 --> 00:10:18,869
- Silly, isn't it?
- Yes, silly. Ha.

110
00:10:19,412 --> 00:10:22,373
No. No, not at all, no.

111
00:10:22,999 --> 00:10:25,543
Oh! Oh, dear.
I'm sorry.

112
00:10:31,465 --> 00:10:34,135
What impropriety is this?

113
00:10:34,302 --> 00:10:36,304
You shouldn't be alone together.

114
00:10:36,470 --> 00:10:41,017
Here it is, one minute before 5,
and you're not at the rehearsal.

115
00:10:41,183 --> 00:10:45,646
Pastor Galswells is waiting.
Come at once.

116
00:10:48,357 --> 00:10:51,235
<i>Master Van Dort, from the beginning.
Again.</i>

117
00:10:51,402 --> 00:10:56,699
"With this hand,
I will lift your sorrows."

118
00:10:57,033 --> 00:11:02,913
Your cup will never empty,
for I will be your wine.

119
00:11:03,080 --> 00:11:09,086
With this candle, I will light
your way in darkness.

120
00:11:09,253 --> 00:11:14,342
"With this ring, I ask
you to be mine."

121
00:11:15,676 --> 00:11:18,929
- Let's try it again.
- Yes. Yes, sir.

122
00:11:19,096 --> 00:11:21,515
With this candle...

123
00:11:23,934 --> 00:11:25,770
This candle...

124
00:11:27,229 --> 00:11:28,856
This candle.

125
00:11:29,690 --> 00:11:31,450
Shall I get up there
and do it for him?

126
00:11:31,567 --> 00:11:33,652
Don't get all aflutter, dear.

127
00:11:39,450 --> 00:11:41,619
With this candle...

128
00:11:43,454 --> 00:11:44,705
Continue!

129
00:11:47,124 --> 00:11:48,959
Get the door, Emil.

130
00:11:49,752 --> 00:11:53,381
Let's just pick it
up at the candle bit.

131
00:11:55,466 --> 00:11:57,802
A Lord Barkis, sir.

132
00:12:01,639 --> 00:12:04,016
I haven't a head for dates.

133
00:12:04,183 --> 00:12:07,186
Apparently, I'm a day
early for the ceremony.

134
00:12:08,396 --> 00:12:12,483
- Is he from your side of the family?
- I can't recall.

135
00:12:12,650 --> 00:12:15,319
Emil, a seat for Lord Barkis.

136
00:12:20,741 --> 00:12:22,493
Do carry on.

137
00:12:23,160 --> 00:12:28,040
Let's try it again, shall
we, Master Van Dort?

138
00:12:28,207 --> 00:12:32,420
- Yes. Yes, sir. Certainly.
- Right.

139
00:12:32,586 --> 00:12:35,506
Right. Oh, right!

140
00:12:35,673 --> 00:12:39,844
- With this... this...
- Hand.

141
00:12:40,010 --> 00:12:42,888
With this hand...

142
00:12:43,055 --> 00:12:44,557
I... With...

143
00:12:44,723 --> 00:12:47,017
Three steps, three!

144
00:12:47,184 --> 00:12:51,647
Can you not count? Do you not wish
to be married, Master Van Dort?

145
00:12:51,814 --> 00:12:53,524
- No! No.
- You do not?

146
00:12:53,691 --> 00:12:57,695
No! I meant, no, I do not
not wish to be married.

147
00:12:57,862 --> 00:13:00,239
That is, I want very much to...
Ow!

148
00:13:00,406 --> 00:13:04,702
Pay attention! Have you
even remembered to bring the ring?

149
00:13:04,869 --> 00:13:07,496
The ring? Yes. Of course.

150
00:13:11,041 --> 00:13:12,084
Dropping the ring.

151
00:13:12,251 --> 00:13:13,502
Oh, no, he's dropped the ring!

152
00:13:13,669 --> 00:13:17,214
- This boy doesn't want to get married.
- How disgraceful!

153
00:13:17,590 --> 00:13:19,258
Excuse me. Got it!

154
00:13:22,928 --> 00:13:25,181
Out of the way, you ninny.

155
00:13:26,015 --> 00:13:30,686
Oh, dear! Oh, my! Giddy on,
a woman on fire! Help! Emergency!

156
00:13:31,979 --> 00:13:36,734
- Oh, I hope it doesn't stain.
- Stop fanning it, you fool.

157
00:13:40,070 --> 00:13:44,658
- Get a bucket, get a bucket.
- I'm on my way, dear. Yes. Oh, dear!

158
00:13:52,708 --> 00:13:58,589
Enough! This wedding cannot take
place until he is properly prepared.

159
00:14:00,216 --> 00:14:05,763
Young man, learn your vows.

160
00:14:20,110 --> 00:14:24,448
Well, he's quite
the catch, isn't he?

161
00:14:39,171 --> 00:14:40,881
Oh, Victoria.

162
00:14:41,340 --> 00:14:45,302
She must think I'm such a fool.
This day couldn't get any worse.

163
00:14:45,469 --> 00:14:47,346
TOWN CRIER Hear ye, hear ye!

164
00:14:47,513 --> 00:14:51,559
Rehearsal in ruins as Van
Dort boy causes chaos!

165
00:14:52,643 --> 00:14:56,647
Fishy fiancé could be canned!

166
00:14:56,814 --> 00:15:02,486
Everglots all fired up as Van
Dort disaster ruins rehearsal!

167
00:15:04,446 --> 00:15:06,657
It really shouldn't be
all that difficult.

168
00:15:06,824 --> 00:15:08,993
It's just a few simple vows.

169
00:15:09,159 --> 00:15:13,205
With this hand,
I will take your wine.

170
00:15:13,372 --> 00:15:14,790
No.

171
00:15:16,041 --> 00:15:17,710
With this hand...

172
00:15:17,876 --> 00:15:19,545
I will cup your...

173
00:15:19,712 --> 00:15:21,297
Oh, goodness, no.

174
00:15:23,090 --> 00:15:25,342
With this...

175
00:15:25,843 --> 00:15:27,428
With this...

176
00:15:27,595 --> 00:15:30,180
With this candle, I will...

177
00:15:31,890 --> 00:15:33,434
I will...

178
00:15:34,101 --> 00:15:36,228
I will set your mother on fire.

179
00:15:38,147 --> 00:15:39,857
Oh, it's no use.

180
00:15:52,411 --> 00:15:57,041
With this hand,
I will lift your sorrows.

181
00:15:57,207 --> 00:16:01,879
Your cup will never empty,
for I will be your wine.

182
00:16:03,130 --> 00:16:04,840
Ah, Mrs. Everglot.

183
00:16:05,466 --> 00:16:07,718
You look ravishing this evening.

184
00:16:08,552 --> 00:16:13,641
What's that, Mr. Everglot? Call you "Dad"?
If you insist, sir.

185
00:16:13,807 --> 00:16:18,312
With this candle, I will light
your way in darkness.

186
00:16:18,812 --> 00:16:20,481
With this ring...

187
00:16:21,231 --> 00:16:24,860
I ask you to be mine.

188
00:17:18,288 --> 00:17:19,498
I do.

189
00:18:48,170 --> 00:18:51,131
You may kiss the bride.

190
00:18:58,180 --> 00:19:01,350
- A new arrival.
- He must've fainted.

191
00:19:01,517 --> 00:19:04,311
- Are you all right?
- What...? What happened?

192
00:19:04,478 --> 00:19:07,564
By Jove, man. Looks like we've got
ourselves a breather.

193
00:19:07,981 --> 00:19:10,859
- Does he have a dead brother?
- He's still soft.

194
00:19:13,862 --> 00:19:15,489
A toast, then.

195
00:19:21,203 --> 00:19:22,788
To the newlyweds.

196
00:19:22,955 --> 00:19:24,206
Newlyweds?

197
00:19:24,373 --> 00:19:29,253
Oh, in the woods, you said
your vows so perfectly.

198
00:19:29,419 --> 00:19:31,046
I did?

199
00:19:31,213 --> 00:19:32,631
I did.

200
00:19:32,798 --> 00:19:35,050
Wake up! Wake up!
Wake up!

201
00:19:35,217 --> 00:19:36,927
<i>Bonjour!</i>

202
00:19:37,094 --> 00:19:40,097
Coming through, coming through.

203
00:19:40,264 --> 00:19:43,058
My name is Paul, I am
the head waiter.

204
00:19:44,434 --> 00:19:47,271
I will be creating
your wedding feast.

205
00:19:47,521 --> 00:19:49,898
Wedding feast!
I'm salivating.

206
00:19:50,858 --> 00:19:52,109
Maggots.

207
00:19:52,276 --> 00:19:54,069
- Oh!
- Hey!

208
00:19:54,987 --> 00:19:56,613
Keep away!

209
00:20:01,869 --> 00:20:05,247
I've got a... I've got a dwarf.

210
00:20:05,414 --> 00:20:08,709
And I'm not afraid to use him.
I want some questions. Now!

211
00:20:08,876 --> 00:20:12,838
- Answers. I think you mean "answers."
- Thank you, yes, answers.

212
00:20:13,005 --> 00:20:16,633
I need answers. What's going on here?
Where am I?

213
00:20:16,800 --> 00:20:17,926
Who are you?

214
00:20:18,093 --> 00:20:21,471
Well, that's kind
of a long story.

215
00:20:21,889 --> 00:20:24,224
What a story it is.

216
00:20:24,391 --> 00:20:27,978
A tragic tale
of romance, passion...

217
00:20:28,145 --> 00:20:29,938
and murder most foul.

218
00:20:30,105 --> 00:20:32,232
- This is gonna be good.
- Oh!

219
00:20:33,817 --> 00:20:35,485
Hit it, boys.

220
00:20:46,121 --> 00:20:49,708
<i>Hey, give me a listen
You corpses of cheer.</i>

221
00:20:49,875 --> 00:20:52,628
<i>At least those of you
Who still got an ear.</i>

222
00:20:52,794 --> 00:20:55,589
<i>I'll tell you a story
Make a skeleton cry.</i>

223
00:20:55,756 --> 00:20:59,259
<i>Of our own jubiliciously
Lovely Corpse Bride.</i>

224
00:20:59,426 --> 00:21:01,845
<i>Die, die, we all pass away.</i>

225
00:21:02,012 --> 00:21:04,765
<i>But don't wear a frown
Because it's really okay.</i>

226
00:21:04,932 --> 00:21:07,476
<i>You might try and hide And
you might try and pray.</i>

227
00:21:07,643 --> 00:21:10,729
<i>But we all end up The
remains of the day.</i>

228
00:21:11,980 --> 00:21:13,315
That's right.

229
00:21:16,151 --> 00:21:19,655
<i>Well, our girl was a beauty
Known for miles around.</i>

230
00:21:19,821 --> 00:21:22,741
<i>When a mysterious
stranger Came into town.</i>

231
00:21:22,908 --> 00:21:25,535
<i>He was plenty good-looking
But down on his cash.</i>

232
00:21:25,702 --> 00:21:28,622
<i>And our poor little baby
She fell hard and fast.</i>

233
00:21:28,789 --> 00:21:31,625
<i>When her daddy said no
She just couldn't cope.</i>

234
00:21:31,792 --> 00:21:34,378
<i>So our lovers came
up With a plan to elope.</i>

235
00:21:35,045 --> 00:21:37,506
<i>Die, die, we all pass away.</i>

236
00:21:37,673 --> 00:21:40,759
<i>But don't wear a frown
Because it's really okay.</i>

237
00:21:40,926 --> 00:21:43,470
<i>You might try and hide And
you might try and pray.</i>

238
00:21:43,637 --> 00:21:46,807
<i>But we all end up The
remains of the day.</i>

239
00:21:47,349 --> 00:21:49,893
<i>Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.</i>

240
00:21:50,102 --> 00:21:52,854
<i>Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.</i>

241
00:21:53,063 --> 00:21:55,857
<i>Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.</i>

242
00:21:56,024 --> 00:21:59,569
<i>Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.</i>

243
00:22:02,197 --> 00:22:03,407
Oh.

244
00:22:03,573 --> 00:22:05,075
That's right.

245
00:22:05,617 --> 00:22:09,329
Ah, okay. Oh, yeah.
Come on, boys, pick it up.

246
00:22:10,205 --> 00:22:13,250
Yeah. Like it.

247
00:22:13,417 --> 00:22:15,335
Okay, Chancy, take it.

248
00:22:17,587 --> 00:22:20,507
Yeah. Whoo!
Yeah!

249
00:22:24,511 --> 00:22:26,471
Yeah!

250
00:22:28,473 --> 00:22:30,058
Yeah!

251
00:22:33,979 --> 00:22:35,897
That's nice.

252
00:22:37,691 --> 00:22:40,485
<i>So they conjured up a plan
To meet late at night.</i>

253
00:22:40,652 --> 00:22:43,030
<i>They told not a soul Kept
the whole thing tight.</i>

254
00:22:43,196 --> 00:22:45,741
<i>Now, her mother's wedding
dress Fit like a glove.</i>

255
00:22:45,907 --> 00:22:48,452
<i>You don't need much When
you're really in love.</i>

256
00:22:48,618 --> 00:22:50,954
<i>Except for a few things
Or so I'm told.</i>

257
00:22:51,121 --> 00:22:53,749
<i>Like the family jewels
And a satchel of gold.</i>

258
00:22:53,915 --> 00:22:56,418
<i>Then next to the graveyard
By the old oak tree.</i>

259
00:22:56,585 --> 00:22:58,837
<i>On a dark, foggy night
At a quarter to 3.</i>

260
00:22:59,004 --> 00:23:02,466
<i>She was ready to go
But where was he?</i>

261
00:23:03,133 --> 00:23:04,468
<i>And then?</i>

262
00:23:04,718 --> 00:23:06,553
- <i>She waited.
- And then?</i>

263
00:23:06,720 --> 00:23:09,598
- <i>There in the shadows, was it her man?
- And then?</i>

264
00:23:09,765 --> 00:23:13,185
- <i>Her little heart beat so loud.
- And then?</i>

265
00:23:13,643 --> 00:23:17,481
<i>And then, baby,
everything went black.</i>

266
00:23:17,981 --> 00:23:20,984
<i>Now, when she opened her
eyes She was dead as dust.</i>

267
00:23:21,151 --> 00:23:24,029
<i>Her jewels were missing
And her heart was bust.</i>

268
00:23:24,196 --> 00:23:26,782
<i>So she made a vow Lying
under that tree.</i>

269
00:23:26,948 --> 00:23:29,743
<i>That she'd wait for her true
love To come set her free.</i>

270
00:23:29,910 --> 00:23:32,746
<i>Always waiting for someone
To ask for her hand.</i>

271
00:23:33,371 --> 00:23:36,249
<i>Then out of the blue Comes
this groovy young man.</i>

272
00:23:36,416 --> 00:23:39,169
<i>Who vows forever
To be by her side.</i>

273
00:23:39,336 --> 00:23:43,173
<i>And that's the story
Of our Corpse Bride.</i>

274
00:23:43,340 --> 00:23:45,092
<i>Die, die, we all pass away.</i>

275
00:23:45,258 --> 00:23:48,011
<i>But don't wear a frown,
Because it's really okay.</i>

276
00:23:48,178 --> 00:23:51,014
<i>You might try and hide And
you might try and pray.</i>

277
00:23:51,181 --> 00:23:56,770
<i>But we all end up The
remains of the day.</i>

278
00:23:57,229 --> 00:23:58,522
Yeah.

279
00:24:10,200 --> 00:24:12,869
Victoria, come away
from the window.

280
00:24:14,162 --> 00:24:16,206
Oh, I'm sure he'll be
back shortly.

281
00:24:16,373 --> 00:24:19,543
He's terrified of the dark.
In fact, when he was a boy...

282
00:24:19,709 --> 00:24:22,587
he used to wet his combinations
regularly, didn't he, William?

283
00:24:23,964 --> 00:24:25,173
Enter.

284
00:24:28,426 --> 00:24:33,140
Ah, Lord Barkis. I trust
the room is to your liking.

285
00:24:33,306 --> 00:24:36,893
Thank you, you
are a most gracious hostess.

286
00:24:37,060 --> 00:24:43,191
Which is why it pains me to be
the bearer of such bad news.

287
00:24:47,320 --> 00:24:50,949
Would you care to repeat
tonight's headline for us?

288
00:24:51,116 --> 00:24:53,118
Hear ye, hear ye!

289
00:24:53,410 --> 00:24:57,914
Victor Van Dort seen this night on the bridge
in the arms of a mystery woman!

290
00:24:58,081 --> 00:25:02,544
The dark-haired temptress and Master
Van Dort slipped away into the night!

291
00:25:02,711 --> 00:25:04,588
And now, the weather.
Scattered showers...

292
00:25:04,754 --> 00:25:07,215
Enough!
That will be all.

293
00:25:10,177 --> 00:25:13,722
Mystery woman? He doesn't
even know any women!

294
00:25:13,889 --> 00:25:15,932
Or so you thought.

295
00:25:16,808 --> 00:25:19,227
Do call for me if you
need my assistance...

296
00:25:20,604 --> 00:25:22,439
in any way.

297
00:25:23,940 --> 00:25:26,902
Good heavens, Finis,
what should we do?

298
00:25:27,068 --> 00:25:28,570
Fetch me musket.

299
00:25:28,737 --> 00:25:30,155
William, do something.

300
00:25:30,322 --> 00:25:32,866
The town crier probably
just had a slow news day.

301
00:25:33,033 --> 00:25:35,827
You know how it is, you need
a little something to cry about.

302
00:25:35,994 --> 00:25:40,498
Regardless, we are one groom
short for the wedding tomorrow.

303
00:25:40,665 --> 00:25:43,835
Not to mention the financial
implications.

304
00:25:44,002 --> 00:25:46,796
A most scandalous
embarrassment for us all.

305
00:25:46,963 --> 00:25:50,425
Oh, give us a chance to find
him, we beg of you.

306
00:25:50,592 --> 00:25:54,429
- Just give us until dawn.
- Very well. Till dawn.

307
00:25:55,138 --> 00:25:58,600
Victor, darling, where are you?

308
00:25:59,017 --> 00:26:02,687
<i>If you ask me, your boyfriend
is kind of jumpy.</i>

309
00:26:02,854 --> 00:26:05,273
He's not my boyfriend,
he's my husband.

310
00:26:05,440 --> 00:26:07,859
Victor, where have you gone?

311
00:26:08,193 --> 00:26:09,903
I'll keep an eye out for him.

312
00:26:10,320 --> 00:26:11,363
Victor?

313
00:26:15,617 --> 00:26:18,620
There he goes, there he goes!
He's... He's getting away!

314
00:26:18,787 --> 00:26:20,830
Quick, quick, after him!

315
00:26:20,997 --> 00:26:22,249
Victor.

316
00:26:27,879 --> 00:26:28,922
Thank you.

317
00:26:29,256 --> 00:26:30,674
Victor!

318
00:26:31,174 --> 00:26:33,176
Where are you?

319
00:26:35,178 --> 00:26:36,721
Victor?

320
00:26:37,389 --> 00:26:39,432
Where have you gone?

321
00:26:39,975 --> 00:26:42,519
Married, huh? I'm a widow.

322
00:26:42,686 --> 00:26:45,522
Oh, how rude. He went that way!

323
00:26:47,190 --> 00:26:48,900
Victor.

324
00:26:50,193 --> 00:26:51,945
Victor, darling.

325
00:26:53,488 --> 00:26:57,200
Please. There's been a mistake.
I'm not dead.

326
00:26:57,993 --> 00:26:59,536
Oh!

327
00:27:00,870 --> 00:27:03,707
Excuse me. Excuse me.

328
00:27:04,624 --> 00:27:05,750
- Excuse me.
- Excuse me.

329
00:27:06,293 --> 00:27:07,836
- Thank you.
- Thank you.

330
00:27:08,628 --> 00:27:10,088
Victor.

331
00:27:12,048 --> 00:27:15,135
- Dead end.
- Victor!

332
00:27:15,427 --> 00:27:16,886
Hello!

333
00:27:25,437 --> 00:27:27,981
Could have used
the stairs, silly.

334
00:27:30,442 --> 00:27:34,654
Isn't the view beautiful?
It takes my breath away.

335
00:27:35,864 --> 00:27:38,116
Well, it would if I had any.

336
00:27:39,784 --> 00:27:41,995
Isn't it romantic?

337
00:27:49,419 --> 00:27:52,672
Look, I am terribly sorry
about what's happened to you...

338
00:27:52,839 --> 00:27:56,134
and I'd like to help,
but I really need to get home.

339
00:27:56,301 --> 00:27:59,471
- This is your home now.
- But I don't even know your name.

340
00:27:59,637 --> 00:28:03,099
<i>Well, that's a great way
to start a marriage.</i>

341
00:28:03,266 --> 00:28:04,684
Shut up!

342
00:28:06,686 --> 00:28:09,564
- It's Emily.
- Emily.

343
00:28:09,731 --> 00:28:13,568
Oh, I almost forgot.
I have something for you.

344
00:28:14,527 --> 00:28:16,529
It's a wedding present.

345
00:28:29,626 --> 00:28:30,960
Thank you.

346
00:28:52,857 --> 00:28:54,150
Scraps?

347
00:28:56,528 --> 00:28:57,987
Scraps!

348
00:28:58,530 --> 00:29:00,115
My dog, Scraps!

349
00:29:02,617 --> 00:29:05,578
Oh, Scraps, what a good boy.

350
00:29:05,745 --> 00:29:07,914
I knew you'd be
happy to see him.

351
00:29:08,081 --> 00:29:12,293
Who's my good boy? Sit.
Sit, Scraps, sit.

352
00:29:12,460 --> 00:29:15,713
Good boy, Scraps. Roll over.
Roll over.

353
00:29:15,880 --> 00:29:18,800
Good boy, Scraps. Play dead.

354
00:29:20,552 --> 00:29:21,970
Sorry.

355
00:29:22,387 --> 00:29:24,013
Oh, what a cutie.

356
00:29:24,180 --> 00:29:26,266
You should have
seen him with fur.

357
00:29:27,100 --> 00:29:29,978
Mother never approved of Scraps
jumping up like this.

358
00:29:30,145 --> 00:29:33,565
But then again, she never
approved of anything.

359
00:29:34,065 --> 00:29:36,568
Do you think she would have
approved of me?

360
00:29:36,860 --> 00:29:39,279
You're lucky you'll never
have to meet her.

361
00:29:41,531 --> 00:29:42,824
Well, actually...

362
00:29:44,242 --> 00:29:48,079
now that you mention it,
I think you should.

363
00:29:48,246 --> 00:29:51,249
In fact, since we're,
you know...

364
00:29:52,292 --> 00:29:55,003
married, you should
definitely meet her.

365
00:29:55,378 --> 00:29:58,173
And my father too. We should
go and see them right now.

366
00:29:58,339 --> 00:30:01,092
What a fantastic idea!
Where are they buried?

367
00:30:01,509 --> 00:30:02,802
Oh.

368
00:30:03,011 --> 00:30:06,181
- What? What is it?
- They're not from around here.

369
00:30:06,347 --> 00:30:07,891
Where are they?

370
00:30:08,808 --> 00:30:10,518
Oh, they're still alive.

371
00:30:10,685 --> 00:30:12,812
- I'm afraid so.
- Well, that is a problem.

372
00:30:12,979 --> 00:30:14,355
What's that, Scraps?

373
00:30:15,690 --> 00:30:17,650
Oh, no, we couldn't possibly.

374
00:30:19,569 --> 00:30:23,323
- Oh, well, if you put it like that.
- What?

375
00:30:23,656 --> 00:30:25,241
Elder Gutknecht.

376
00:30:34,626 --> 00:30:35,668
Shh, Scraps.

377
00:30:35,835 --> 00:30:38,171
Elder Gutknecht...

378
00:30:38,588 --> 00:30:40,089
are you there?

379
00:30:43,092 --> 00:30:46,054
Hello? Is anyone home?

380
00:30:46,930 --> 00:30:48,389
Hello?

381
00:30:59,776 --> 00:31:01,486
There you are!

382
00:31:02,153 --> 00:31:04,572
Oh, my dear. There you are.

383
00:31:04,739 --> 00:31:07,158
I've brought my husband, Victor.

384
00:31:07,325 --> 00:31:10,119
What's that? Husband?

385
00:31:10,495 --> 00:31:12,747
Pleasure to meet you, sir.

386
00:31:13,540 --> 00:31:17,961
We need to go up. Upstairs?
To visit the land of the living.

387
00:31:18,127 --> 00:31:20,380
Land of the living?

388
00:31:23,174 --> 00:31:24,425
Oh, my dear.

389
00:31:24,592 --> 00:31:26,386
Please, Elder Gutknecht.

390
00:31:26,553 --> 00:31:30,390
Now, why go up there, when people
are dying to get down here?

391
00:31:30,557 --> 00:31:33,643
Sir, I beg you to help.
It means so much to me...

392
00:31:34,769 --> 00:31:38,856
- Us.
- I don't know, it's just not natural.

393
00:31:39,023 --> 00:31:40,942
Please, Elder Gutknecht.

394
00:31:41,109 --> 00:31:43,736
Surely there must be
something you can do.

395
00:31:43,987 --> 00:31:45,488
Hmm.

396
00:31:45,697 --> 00:31:48,324
Let me see what I can do.

397
00:31:48,658 --> 00:31:51,536
Where did I put that book?

398
00:31:58,209 --> 00:32:00,461
I left it here somewhere.

399
00:32:03,840 --> 00:32:05,967
Ah, there's the one.

400
00:32:13,558 --> 00:32:14,976
Umm...

401
00:32:19,689 --> 00:32:21,274
I have it.

402
00:32:21,691 --> 00:32:26,362
A Ukrainian haunting spell.
Just the thing for these quick trips.

403
00:32:26,988 --> 00:32:29,365
So glad you thought of this.

404
00:32:29,532 --> 00:32:30,742
Me too.

405
00:32:38,249 --> 00:32:39,626
Ah.

406
00:32:54,349 --> 00:32:55,642
Now, then...

407
00:32:57,018 --> 00:32:58,353
Where were we?

408
00:32:59,562 --> 00:33:02,440
- The Ukrainian haunting spell?
- Aha.

409
00:33:10,281 --> 00:33:13,743
Ah, here we have it. Ready?

410
00:33:13,910 --> 00:33:17,830
Just remember, when you want
to come back, say "Hopscotch."

411
00:33:17,997 --> 00:33:20,750
- Hopscotch?
- That's it.

412
00:33:37,266 --> 00:33:39,477
I spent so long
in the darkness...

413
00:33:39,644 --> 00:33:44,357
I'd almost forgotten
how beautiful the moonlight is.

414
00:34:11,634 --> 00:34:13,928
Psst. Hey, I think you
dropped something.

415
00:34:33,072 --> 00:34:34,657
Hold on, hold on.

416
00:34:36,659 --> 00:34:40,997
I think I should prepare Mother
and Father for the big news.

417
00:34:42,707 --> 00:34:44,667
I'll go ahead and you...

418
00:34:45,501 --> 00:34:46,961
wait here.

419
00:34:47,545 --> 00:34:50,173
- Perfect.
- I won't be long.

420
00:34:51,007 --> 00:34:53,926
Stay right here.
I'll be right back.

421
00:34:54,093 --> 00:34:55,678
Okay.

422
00:34:56,387 --> 00:34:58,097
No peeking.

423
00:35:17,366 --> 00:35:20,286
If ever I see
that Van Dort boy...

424
00:35:20,453 --> 00:35:23,706
I'll strangle him
with my bare hands.

425
00:35:23,873 --> 00:35:28,044
Your hands are too fat,
and his neck is too thin.

426
00:35:28,211 --> 00:35:29,545
You'll have to use a rope.

427
00:35:40,473 --> 00:35:45,311
<i>This is the voice of your conscience.
Listen to what I say.</i>

428
00:35:45,478 --> 00:35:49,690
<i>I have a bad feeling about that boy.
You know he is no...</i>

429
00:35:51,776 --> 00:35:54,153
Go chew someone
else's ear for a while.

430
00:35:54,320 --> 00:35:58,074
Victor has gone to see
his parents, just like he said.

431
00:35:58,699 --> 00:36:02,578
If I hadn't just been sitting in it,
I would say that you had lost your mind!

432
00:36:02,745 --> 00:36:07,208
I'm sure he has a perfectly
good reason for taking so long.

433
00:36:07,375 --> 00:36:10,586
I am sure he does.
Why don't you go ask him?

434
00:36:10,753 --> 00:36:11,796
All right, I will.

435
00:36:11,963 --> 00:36:16,551
After all, he couldn't get
far with those cold feet.

436
00:36:55,006 --> 00:36:59,010
- Victoria.
- Victor? I'm so happy to see you.

437
00:36:59,176 --> 00:37:03,180
Come by the fire. Where have you been?
Are you all right?

438
00:37:03,723 --> 00:37:05,391
I... I...

439
00:37:05,600 --> 00:37:06,934
Oh, dear.

440
00:37:07,768 --> 00:37:11,355
You're as cold as death.
What's happened to you?

441
00:37:11,522 --> 00:37:13,399
Your coat.

442
00:37:14,191 --> 00:37:17,111
Victoria, I confess.

443
00:37:18,321 --> 00:37:21,490
This morning I was terrified
of marriage.

444
00:37:22,992 --> 00:37:27,496
But then, on meeting you, I felt
I should be with you always...

445
00:37:27,663 --> 00:37:31,876
and that our wedding could
not come soon enough.

446
00:37:32,251 --> 00:37:33,961
Oh!

447
00:37:34,837 --> 00:37:38,299
Victor, I feel the same.

448
00:37:43,179 --> 00:37:45,848
Victoria, I se... I se...

449
00:37:46,015 --> 00:37:48,559
I seem to find myself married.

450
00:37:48,726 --> 00:37:50,478
And you should know
it's unexpected.

451
00:37:55,358 --> 00:37:56,984
My darling, I just
wanted to meet...

452
00:38:00,404 --> 00:38:03,074
Darling? Who's this?

453
00:38:03,240 --> 00:38:06,702
- Who is she?
- I'm his wife.

454
00:38:08,120 --> 00:38:10,665
- Victor?
- Victoria, wait. You don't understand.

455
00:38:11,123 --> 00:38:13,376
She's dead. Look.

456
00:38:17,046 --> 00:38:18,339
Hopscotch.

457
00:38:21,217 --> 00:38:24,011
No! No!
Victoria!

458
00:38:28,891 --> 00:38:30,851
You lied to me!

459
00:38:31,018 --> 00:38:33,521
Just to get back
to that other woman.

460
00:38:33,688 --> 00:38:36,607
Don't you understand?
You're the other woman.

461
00:38:36,774 --> 00:38:41,320
No! You're married to me.
She's the other woman.

462
00:38:44,949 --> 00:38:46,742
She's got a point.

463
00:38:47,410 --> 00:38:52,581
And I thought... I thought
this was all going so well.

464
00:39:01,424 --> 00:39:04,719
Look, I'm sorry, but...

465
00:39:04,885 --> 00:39:06,345
this just can't work.

466
00:39:06,512 --> 00:39:08,431
Why not?

467
00:39:09,432 --> 00:39:11,642
It's my eye, isn't it?

468
00:39:11,809 --> 00:39:13,477
No. Your eye is...

469
00:39:14,603 --> 00:39:15,896
lovely.

470
00:39:16,772 --> 00:39:21,110
Listen, under different
circumstances, well, who knows?

471
00:39:21,527 --> 00:39:25,906
But we're just too different.
I mean, you're dead.

472
00:39:26,073 --> 00:39:29,118
You should've thought about that before you
asked me to marry you.

473
00:39:29,285 --> 00:39:32,788
Why can't you understand? It was a mistake.
I would never marry you.

474
00:40:03,194 --> 00:40:05,905
Roses for eternal love.

475
00:40:06,989 --> 00:40:09,366
Lilies for sweetness.

476
00:40:12,161 --> 00:40:13,704
Baby's breath.

477
00:40:19,502 --> 00:40:21,128
Why so blue?

478
00:40:21,295 --> 00:40:24,340
Maybe he's right.
Maybe we are too different.

479
00:40:24,507 --> 00:40:27,134
<i>Maybe he should have
his head examined.</i>

480
00:40:28,677 --> 00:40:30,471
I could do it.

481
00:40:30,638 --> 00:40:34,141
Or perhaps he does belong with her.
Little Miss Living.

482
00:40:34,308 --> 00:40:37,686
With her rosy cheeks
and beating heart.

483
00:40:38,187 --> 00:40:42,358
Oh, those girls are 10 a penny.
You've got so much more.

484
00:40:42,525 --> 00:40:44,860
You've got... You've got...

485
00:40:45,027 --> 00:40:47,530
You've got a wonderful
personality.

486
00:40:54,578 --> 00:40:59,041
<i>What does that wispy little brat
have That you don't have double?</i>

487
00:40:59,208 --> 00:41:02,837
<i>She can't hold a candle To
the beauty of your smile.</i>

488
00:41:03,003 --> 00:41:04,255
How about a pulse?

489
00:41:04,421 --> 00:41:05,756
<i>Overrated by a mile.</i>

490
00:41:05,923 --> 00:41:07,216
- <i>Overvalued.
- Overblown.</i>

491
00:41:07,424 --> 00:41:11,220
<i>If he only knew The
you that we know.</i>

492
00:41:12,513 --> 00:41:15,474
<i>And that silly little creature
Isn't wearing his ring.</i>

493
00:41:15,641 --> 00:41:19,061
<i>And she doesn't play
piano Or dance, or sing.</i>

494
00:41:19,228 --> 00:41:20,980
<i>No, she doesn't compare.</i>

495
00:41:21,147 --> 00:41:23,399
- <i>But she still breathes air.
- Who cares?</i>

496
00:41:23,566 --> 00:41:24,859
- <i>Unimportant.
- Overrated.</i>

497
00:41:25,025 --> 00:41:27,236
- <i>Overblown.
- If only he could see.</i>

498
00:41:27,403 --> 00:41:29,029
<i>How special you can be.</i>

499
00:41:29,196 --> 00:41:33,242
<i>If he only knew The
you that we know.</i>

500
00:41:39,081 --> 00:41:44,003
<i>If I touch a burning
candle I can feel no pain.</i>

501
00:41:44,753 --> 00:41:48,465
<i>If you cut me with a knife
It's still the same.</i>

502
00:41:50,217 --> 00:41:53,179
<i>And I know her heart is beating.</i>

503
00:41:53,721 --> 00:41:56,098
<i>And I know that I am dead.</i>

504
00:41:56,599 --> 00:41:58,934
<i>Yet the pain here that I feel.</i>

505
00:41:59,602 --> 00:42:02,188
<i>Try and tell me it's not real.</i>

506
00:42:02,771 --> 00:42:07,234
<i>And it seems that I still
have A tear to shed.</i>

507
00:42:11,697 --> 00:42:14,950
<i>The sole redeeming feature
From that little creature.</i>

508
00:42:15,117 --> 00:42:16,493
<i>Is that she's alive.</i>

509
00:42:16,660 --> 00:42:18,287
- <i>Overrated.
- Overblown.</i>

510
00:42:18,454 --> 00:42:21,498
<i>Everybody knows That's just
a temporary state.</i>

511
00:42:21,665 --> 00:42:24,877
<i>Which is cured very quickly
When we meet our fate.</i>

512
00:42:25,044 --> 00:42:26,587
- <i>Who cares?
- Unimportant.</i>

513
00:42:26,754 --> 00:42:28,130
- <i>Overrated.
- Overblown.</i>

514
00:42:28,297 --> 00:42:31,550
<i>If only he could see How
special you can be.</i>

515
00:42:31,717 --> 00:42:36,180
<i>If he only knew The
you that we know.</i>

516
00:42:41,477 --> 00:42:46,815
<i>If I touch a burning
candle I can feel no pain.</i>

517
00:42:47,191 --> 00:42:51,237
<i>In the ice or in the sun
It's all the same.</i>

518
00:42:52,988 --> 00:42:55,658
<i>Yet I feel my heart is aching.</i>

519
00:42:56,158 --> 00:42:58,994
<i>Though it doesn't
beat, it's breaking.</i>

520
00:42:59,161 --> 00:43:01,664
<i>And the pain here that I feel.</i>

521
00:43:02,122 --> 00:43:04,375
<i>Try and tell me it's not real.</i>

522
00:43:05,167 --> 00:43:07,836
<i>I know that I am dead.</i>

523
00:43:08,796 --> 00:43:13,259
<i>Yet it seems that I still
have Some tears to shed.</i>

524
00:43:22,434 --> 00:43:24,311
It's true, Mother!

525
00:43:24,478 --> 00:43:27,231
Victor is married
to a dead woman.

526
00:43:27,398 --> 00:43:32,194
I saw her. A corpse!
Standing right here with Victor.

527
00:43:32,361 --> 00:43:33,904
Victor was in your room?

528
00:43:34,071 --> 00:43:35,447
I have to help him.

529
00:43:35,614 --> 00:43:37,157
The scandal!

530
00:43:37,324 --> 00:43:41,161
Come sit in your chair, dearie.
You're shaking like a leaf.

531
00:43:41,328 --> 00:43:43,372
Let Hilde fetch you a blanket.

532
00:43:43,539 --> 00:43:46,917
Fetch her a straitjacket!
She's completely mad!

533
00:43:47,084 --> 00:43:48,961
Come, Hildegarde.

534
00:44:22,244 --> 00:44:25,164
Finis, come to bed at once.

535
00:44:31,003 --> 00:44:32,671
Oh!

536
00:44:45,934 --> 00:44:48,896
What in heaven's name?

537
00:44:51,482 --> 00:44:54,485
Who could that be at this hour?

538
00:44:56,028 --> 00:44:57,279
Miss Everglot.

539
00:44:57,738 --> 00:45:01,992
What are you doing here? You should
be at home, prostrate with grief.

540
00:45:02,159 --> 00:45:04,870
Pastor Galswells, I have
to ask you something.

541
00:45:05,037 --> 00:45:08,457
- This is most irregular.
- Please, I beg of you.

542
00:45:08,624 --> 00:45:13,128
You are the only one in the village
who knows of what awaits beyond the grave.

543
00:45:13,295 --> 00:45:16,006
A grim topic for a bride-to-be.

544
00:45:16,298 --> 00:45:21,136
It is a bride I fear,
which is why I must know:

545
00:45:21,678 --> 00:45:23,889
Can the living marry the dead?

546
00:45:24,139 --> 00:45:26,934
What on earth are you
speaking about?

547
00:45:27,101 --> 00:45:30,062
Please, it's Victor.
He's married to a corpse.

548
00:45:30,479 --> 00:45:32,731
He has a corpse bride!

549
00:45:32,898 --> 00:45:36,610
There must be some way
to undo what's been done.

550
00:45:37,194 --> 00:45:38,779
Hmm.

551
00:45:38,987 --> 00:45:41,990
I believe I know
the thing to do.

552
00:45:42,658 --> 00:45:43,992
Come with me.

553
00:45:46,829 --> 00:45:49,331
Victoria?
Where are your corsets?

554
00:45:49,498 --> 00:45:53,168
She's speaking in tongues.
Of unholy alliances.

555
00:45:53,335 --> 00:45:55,629
Her mind has come
undone, I fear.

556
00:45:55,796 --> 00:45:57,923
It's not true! Let me go!
Let me go!

557
00:45:58,090 --> 00:46:02,803
Thank you, Pastor Galswells.
Thank you so very much.

558
00:46:03,429 --> 00:46:04,763
Take her to her room!

559
00:46:04,930 --> 00:46:07,349
No, I'm telling the truth.

560
00:46:07,516 --> 00:46:09,393
Victor needs my help.

561
00:46:09,560 --> 00:46:11,812
Hildegarde, you believe
me, don't you?

562
00:46:11,979 --> 00:46:14,898
- Mother, Father, please.
- Seal the doors...

563
00:46:15,065 --> 00:46:19,528
and bar the windows. See to it
that she doesn't escape again.

564
00:46:20,112 --> 00:46:24,116
He needs our help! Oh, let me go!
Let me go!

565
00:46:24,283 --> 00:46:28,328
Will the mortification
never cease?

566
00:46:28,495 --> 00:46:31,707
It will be years before we can
show ourselves in public again.

567
00:46:31,874 --> 00:46:33,125
What shall we do?

568
00:46:33,292 --> 00:46:36,920
We shall continue as planned,
with or without Vincent.

569
00:46:37,087 --> 00:46:39,381
- Victor.
- Whatever.

570
00:46:39,548 --> 00:46:44,261
For that boy to toss aside a young
woman like Victoria...

571
00:46:44,428 --> 00:46:46,472
it's positively criminal.

572
00:46:46,638 --> 00:46:50,851
Why, if I had a woman
like your daughter on my arm...

573
00:46:51,018 --> 00:46:55,606
I would lavish her with riches
befitting royalty.

574
00:46:55,772 --> 00:46:59,443
Your lady wife
is a most fortunate woman.

575
00:46:59,610 --> 00:47:02,488
Alas, I am not married.

576
00:47:02,654 --> 00:47:04,531
I was betrothed
some years ago...

577
00:47:04,698 --> 00:47:08,619
but tragedy snatched
my young bride away.

578
00:47:08,869 --> 00:47:12,873
When one lives alone,
wealth counts for naught.

579
00:47:14,208 --> 00:47:15,876
Oh.

580
00:47:20,964 --> 00:47:24,885
Marvelous news, Victoria,
there'll be a wedding after all.

581
00:47:25,052 --> 00:47:26,345
You found him?

582
00:47:26,512 --> 00:47:29,973
Make haste, my dear, our relatives
will arrive at any moment.

583
00:47:30,140 --> 00:47:33,602
We must have you looking
presentable for Lord Barkis.

584
00:47:35,604 --> 00:47:36,897
Lord Barkis?

585
00:47:37,064 --> 00:47:38,607
He will make a fine husband.

586
00:47:38,774 --> 00:47:42,110
Aye. A fortuitous turn
of events indeed.

587
00:47:42,277 --> 00:47:44,530
A far better prospect this time.

588
00:47:44,696 --> 00:47:48,408
But I do not love him.
You cannot make me do this.

589
00:47:48,575 --> 00:47:51,453
- We must.
- Please, I beg of you.

590
00:47:51,620 --> 00:47:53,038
There must be another way.

591
00:47:53,205 --> 00:47:55,123
Without your marriage
to Lord Barkis...

592
00:47:55,290 --> 00:47:57,793
we shall be forced,
penniless, into the street.

593
00:47:57,960 --> 00:47:59,419
We are destitute.

594
00:47:59,836 --> 00:48:01,547
But Victor...

595
00:48:01,713 --> 00:48:04,258
Victor Van Dort has gone, child.

596
00:48:04,424 --> 00:48:07,469
You shall marry Lord
Barkis tomorrow.

597
00:48:10,180 --> 00:48:12,391
- According to plan.
- According to plan.

598
00:48:41,128 --> 00:48:44,798
Oh, my dear. Oh, don't
look at me that way.

599
00:48:44,965 --> 00:48:49,303
You have only to suffer this
union until death do us part.

600
00:48:49,636 --> 00:48:53,307
And that will come
sooner than you think.

601
00:48:56,602 --> 00:48:58,562
Oh, it's almost dawn!
Where could he be?

602
00:48:58,729 --> 00:49:01,815
Victor Van Dort
elopes with corpse!

603
00:49:01,982 --> 00:49:05,694
Heartbroken bride to wed
wealthy newcomer!

604
00:49:05,861 --> 00:49:08,530
Wealthy newcomer? It cannot be.

605
00:49:08,697 --> 00:49:10,449
Did he say corpse?

606
00:49:10,616 --> 00:49:13,201
Oh, don't be ridiculous.
What corpse would marry our Victor?

607
00:49:14,953 --> 00:49:20,626
Oh, Mayhew!
Silence that blasted coughing.

608
00:49:37,184 --> 00:49:39,770
Mayhew, are you
trying to kill us?

609
00:49:39,936 --> 00:49:42,230
I think he's trying to kill us.

610
00:50:21,395 --> 00:50:22,729
I...

611
00:50:23,939 --> 00:50:25,774
think you dropped this.

612
00:50:34,908 --> 00:50:36,243
I'm sorry.

613
00:50:36,660 --> 00:50:40,372
I'm sorry I lied to you
about wanting to see my parents.

614
00:50:40,664 --> 00:50:44,876
It's just this whole day
hasn't gone quite, well...

615
00:50:47,504 --> 00:50:49,172
according to plan.

616
00:51:54,738 --> 00:51:56,364
Pardon my enthusiasm.

617
00:51:56,698 --> 00:51:58,742
I like your enthusiasm.

618
00:52:03,371 --> 00:52:06,875
- New arrival! New arrival!
- Lights up!

619
00:52:10,337 --> 00:52:11,713
Hurry up, boys! <i>Vite, vite.</i>

620
00:52:12,297 --> 00:52:14,508
<i>Bonjour! Bienvenue!</i>

621
00:52:14,674 --> 00:52:16,301
Drinks for everyone.

622
00:52:16,468 --> 00:52:17,552
Another pint, sir?

623
00:52:17,719 --> 00:52:19,763
- No, no. Just a half.
- No, no. Just a half.

624
00:52:25,018 --> 00:52:27,687
It is impossible to get
good help anymore.

625
00:52:27,854 --> 00:52:30,565
Welcoming committee, coming through!
Coming through!

626
00:52:30,732 --> 00:52:35,570
- My name's Plum. Miss Plum.
- Mayhew?

627
00:52:37,072 --> 00:52:39,491
Mayhew! How nice to see...

628
00:52:41,743 --> 00:52:42,911
I'm so sorry.

629
00:52:43,078 --> 00:52:47,457
Oh, yeah. Actually,
though, I feel great.

630
00:52:49,543 --> 00:52:53,421
Hurry up, boys. Can you not
see the gentleman is parched?

631
00:52:54,339 --> 00:52:57,259
Mayhew, I have to get back.

632
00:52:57,425 --> 00:52:59,970
They all must be worried sick.
How is everyone?

633
00:53:00,136 --> 00:53:04,099
Well, they're still wondering
where you slipped off to.

634
00:53:04,266 --> 00:53:06,476
Oh, and Miss Victoria...

635
00:53:06,643 --> 00:53:08,228
Yes? Yes, how is she?

636
00:53:08,395 --> 00:53:11,314
Well, she's getting
married this evening.

637
00:53:11,481 --> 00:53:13,483
What? Married to who?

638
00:53:13,650 --> 00:53:17,320
Some newcomer, Lord
Somebody-or-Other.

639
00:53:17,487 --> 00:53:18,822
But that's impossible!

640
00:53:18,989 --> 00:53:21,157
Yeah, with you gone and all...

641
00:53:21,324 --> 00:53:23,702
I guess they didn't
wanna waste the cake.

642
00:53:26,788 --> 00:53:27,831
But how could she?

643
00:53:27,998 --> 00:53:30,834
Women, you can't live with them.

644
00:53:31,001 --> 00:53:33,295
You can't live with... Hiccup!

645
00:53:35,255 --> 00:53:40,343
Time to pick up the pieces and...
You know, and move on, I suppose.

646
00:53:41,469 --> 00:53:43,597
Speaking of picking
up the pieces?

647
00:53:47,017 --> 00:53:50,312
Victor? Where are you going?

648
00:53:53,481 --> 00:53:58,320
Miss Victoria, we must
leave for the church now.

649
00:53:58,695 --> 00:54:02,157
Yesterday I thought
my wedding would be happy.

650
00:54:02,365 --> 00:54:06,369
Now I feel like I'm caught
in the tide, pulled out to sea.

651
00:54:06,536 --> 00:54:10,248
The sea leads
to many places, dearie.

652
00:54:11,166 --> 00:54:14,669
Maybe you'll land
somewhere better.

653
00:54:20,508 --> 00:54:25,055
With this candle, I will light
your way in darkness.

654
00:54:31,102 --> 00:54:36,775
With this ring, I ask
you to be mine.

655
00:54:40,570 --> 00:54:45,200
I now pronounce
you man and wife.

656
00:54:45,784 --> 00:54:47,744
Oh, oh, dear.

657
00:55:03,718 --> 00:55:05,637
I'm too late.

658
00:55:09,891 --> 00:55:12,394
Oh, Mrs. Plum, what am I to do?

659
00:55:12,560 --> 00:55:16,773
He just walked off without saying a word.
Are all men like this?

660
00:55:16,940 --> 00:55:19,818
Well, I'm afraid none of them
are very bright.

661
00:55:19,985 --> 00:55:21,903
They get something stuck
in their heads...

662
00:55:22,070 --> 00:55:24,614
and you can't do
a thing with them.

663
00:55:25,615 --> 00:55:28,076
My dear, we have to talk.

664
00:55:28,243 --> 00:55:30,578
Let me tell her, please.
Let me tell her.

665
00:55:30,745 --> 00:55:32,580
- Heh, heh, heh.
- What?

666
00:55:32,747 --> 00:55:35,792
There is a complication
with your marriage.

667
00:55:36,292 --> 00:55:37,794
I don't understand.

668
00:55:37,961 --> 00:55:42,424
The vows are binding
only until death do you part.

669
00:55:42,799 --> 00:55:44,092
What are you saying?

670
00:55:44,801 --> 00:55:47,554
Death has already parted you.

671
00:55:48,930 --> 00:55:50,598
If he finds out, he'll leave.

672
00:55:50,765 --> 00:55:52,809
There must be
something you can do.

673
00:55:52,976 --> 00:55:55,770
Well, there is one way.

674
00:55:55,937 --> 00:55:57,814
Oh, please, please,
let me tell her.

675
00:55:57,981 --> 00:56:01,026
It requires
the greatest sacrifice.

676
00:56:01,609 --> 00:56:04,988
- Go on, get to the good part.
- What is it?

677
00:56:05,155 --> 00:56:07,866
- We have to kill him!
- What?

678
00:56:08,033 --> 00:56:12,787
Victor would have to give
up the life he had forever.

679
00:56:13,163 --> 00:56:17,000
He would need to repeat his vows
in the land of the living...

680
00:56:17,167 --> 00:56:20,462
and drink from the wine of ages.

681
00:56:21,296 --> 00:56:22,547
Poison!

682
00:56:22,797 --> 00:56:25,967
This would stop
his heart forever.

683
00:56:26,134 --> 00:56:29,387
Only then would he be
free to give it to you.

684
00:56:32,474 --> 00:56:35,018
I could never ask him.

685
00:56:37,479 --> 00:56:39,314
You don't have to.

686
00:56:41,816 --> 00:56:43,109
I'll do it.

687
00:56:43,526 --> 00:56:46,488
My boy, if you
choose this path...

688
00:56:46,654 --> 00:56:49,491
you may never return
to the world above.

689
00:56:49,657 --> 00:56:51,242
Do you understand?

690
00:56:54,662 --> 00:56:56,664
I do.

691
00:56:57,040 --> 00:56:59,876
Gather round.
Gather round, everybody.

692
00:57:03,630 --> 00:57:06,174
We've decided to do
this thing properly.

693
00:57:06,341 --> 00:57:08,760
So grab what you
can and follow us.

694
00:57:08,927 --> 00:57:11,513
We're moving this
wedding party upstairs.

695
00:57:11,679 --> 00:57:15,850
Upstairs? I didn't know
we had an upstairs.

696
00:57:16,017 --> 00:57:18,561
- Sounds creepy.
- Let's go!

697
00:57:19,020 --> 00:57:22,065
<i>A wedding, a wedding We're
going to have a wedding.</i>

698
00:57:24,734 --> 00:57:26,903
Hold on, Victor.

699
00:57:27,070 --> 00:57:30,281
You can't get married
looking like that.

700
00:57:30,448 --> 00:57:33,743
<i>The spiders think you're very cute
But goodness knows you need a suit.</i>

701
00:57:33,910 --> 00:57:37,789
<i>But have no fears, we're quite adept
We'll have you looking lovely, lovely.</i>

702
00:57:37,956 --> 00:57:40,333
<i>Lovely, lovely, lovely,
lovely, lovely yet.</i>

703
00:57:41,167 --> 00:57:44,337
<i>A little stitch, a little tuck
Some tender loving care.</i>

704
00:57:44,504 --> 00:57:47,632
<i>A little thread will fix you up And
we've got plenty as you see.</i>

705
00:57:47,799 --> 00:57:51,177
<i>And personally guarantee
Our quality repairs.</i>

706
00:57:51,344 --> 00:57:54,764
<i>A little here, I'll fix the mess
We're going to do our very best.</i>

707
00:57:54,931 --> 00:57:57,559
<i>When everybody sees you They
will all be quite impressed.</i>

708
00:57:57,725 --> 00:58:01,604
<i>They will all be
quite impressed.</i>

709
00:58:01,771 --> 00:58:03,481
<i>A wedding, we're going to have.</i>

710
00:58:03,648 --> 00:58:06,734
<i>A wedding cake is no mistake
It must be quite sublime.</i>

711
00:58:06,901 --> 00:58:08,653
- <i>We're missing something.
- Try some dust.</i>

712
00:58:08,820 --> 00:58:10,155
<i>I wish I had more time.</i>

713
00:58:10,321 --> 00:58:13,241
<i>Perhaps there's something I can
do These bones might help a bit.</i>

714
00:58:13,408 --> 00:58:15,243
- Oh, my nose.
- Sorry.

715
00:58:15,410 --> 00:58:16,661
<i>Wait a minute, that's it.</i>

716
00:58:16,828 --> 00:58:18,348
- <i>A little of that.
- A little of this.</i>

717
00:58:18,413 --> 00:58:20,081
<i>The perfect cake
is hard to miss.</i>

718
00:58:20,290 --> 00:58:22,584
<i>A wedding, a wedding
We're going to have.</i>

719
00:58:22,750 --> 00:58:24,043
<i>A wedding.</i>

720
00:58:24,210 --> 00:58:25,837
<i>Huzzah, huzzah.</i>

721
00:58:26,004 --> 00:58:28,548
<i>We're going to have
a wedding A wedding.</i>

722
00:58:29,174 --> 00:58:34,888
<i>Let's all give out a cheer 'cause
The bride is getting married today.</i>

723
00:58:35,054 --> 00:58:36,097
Hurray!

724
00:58:36,264 --> 00:58:39,184
<i>One thing you can surely say
Is we will stand beside.</i>

725
00:58:39,350 --> 00:58:42,270
<i>Until the end we will defend
Our one and only bride.</i>

726
00:58:42,437 --> 00:58:45,607
<i>Our bride-to-be, our bride-to-be
Our lovely Corpse Bride.</i>

727
00:58:45,773 --> 00:58:47,609
<i>Huzzah! Hooray! Huzzah! Hooray!</i>

728
00:58:47,775 --> 00:58:51,988
<i>Our bride is getting
married today.</i>

729
00:58:52,155 --> 00:58:54,199
- Oh, there she is.
- Here she comes.

730
00:58:59,412 --> 00:59:03,082
<i>Oh, oh, the bride is here.</i>

731
00:59:03,249 --> 00:59:07,045
<i>She's waited for this

732
00:59:07,212 --> 00:59:11,382
<i>For this day, for this day

740
00:59:44,916 --> 00:59:48,628
<i>The living in the land above Will

744
01:00:07,146 --> 01:00:14,946
<i>To celebrate.</i>

745
01:00:17,365 --> 01:00:19,867
Oh, dear.

746
01:00:31,337 --> 01:00:34,716
Quiet down now, everyone.

747
01:00:35,842 --> 01:00:37,802
Mm-hm.

748
01:00:39,220 --> 01:00:40,722
Thank you.

749
01:00:41,723 --> 01:00:46,227
Elegant, cultured, radiant.

750
01:00:46,894 --> 01:00:49,647
Victoria has found a husband...

751
01:00:49,814 --> 01:00:53,985
with all these
qualities and more.

752
01:00:54,152 --> 01:00:56,738
Serendipity brought
us together...

753
01:00:56,904 --> 01:01:01,200
and no force on earth
could tear us apart.

754
01:01:01,367 --> 01:01:02,452
Oh!

755
01:01:02,660 --> 01:01:04,078
Mm?

756
01:01:22,764 --> 01:01:24,557
There's an eye in me soup.

757
01:01:28,770 --> 01:01:30,688
- Ooooh!
- Oh! Oh!

758
01:01:31,272 --> 01:01:32,315
Aaah!

759
01:01:34,567 --> 01:01:35,610
Oh, sorry.

760
01:01:42,658 --> 01:01:43,868
Fetch me musket!

761
01:01:44,035 --> 01:01:46,162
Fetch your own musket. I'm off!

762
01:01:46,329 --> 01:01:48,581
Coming through. Coming through.

763
01:01:51,834 --> 01:01:56,589
Excuse me, you don't know me,
but I used to live in your dead mother.

764
01:01:57,882 --> 01:01:59,509
Hey, hold on there.

765
01:02:00,009 --> 01:02:03,554
I love a woman with meat on her bones.
Heh, heh, heh.

766
01:02:04,806 --> 01:02:07,350
Finis, who invited these people?

767
01:02:08,309 --> 01:02:10,436
They must be from your side
of the family.

768
01:02:10,603 --> 01:02:11,854
Certainly not.

769
01:02:12,021 --> 01:02:15,983
Why, if my Grandfather Everglot could
see this, he'd be turning in his grave.

770
01:02:16,150 --> 01:02:18,111
Finis.

771
01:02:19,612 --> 01:02:21,823
Where do you keep the spirits?

772
01:02:30,665 --> 01:02:31,874
In other news...

773
01:02:32,041 --> 01:02:34,836
the dead walk the earth!

774
01:02:39,549 --> 01:02:43,261
Get back! Don't try
and sneak up on me!

775
01:02:43,428 --> 01:02:44,887
Get back!

776
01:02:46,264 --> 01:02:48,099
I'll give you such a wallop.

777
01:02:59,652 --> 01:03:00,903
No.

778
01:03:01,070 --> 01:03:02,447
Yeah.

779
01:03:16,919 --> 01:03:18,713
Grandpa?

780
01:03:19,213 --> 01:03:20,798
Aww...

781
01:03:20,965 --> 01:03:22,133
Huh?

782
01:03:22,341 --> 01:03:23,885
- Bounder!
- Sweetie pie.

783
01:03:24,051 --> 01:03:25,470
- Monster.
- Buttercup.

784
01:03:25,636 --> 01:03:27,430
- Cad!
- Gertrude!

785
01:03:27,889 --> 01:03:29,432
Alfred?

786
01:03:29,807 --> 01:03:30,933
Oh?

787
01:03:31,100 --> 01:03:34,020
You've been dead for 15 years.

788
01:03:34,187 --> 01:03:38,065
Frankly, my dear,
I don't give a damn.

789
01:03:38,232 --> 01:03:39,984
Ethel!

790
01:03:50,328 --> 01:03:52,121
Wait. That's it.

791
01:03:52,288 --> 01:03:55,708
We're going to take whatever money
we can and get out of here.

792
01:03:55,875 --> 01:03:58,294
Money? What money?

793
01:03:58,461 --> 01:04:00,838
Your dowry. It's my right!

794
01:04:01,005 --> 01:04:03,007
But my parents don't
have any money.

795
01:04:03,174 --> 01:04:07,887
It's my marriage to you
that will save them from the poorhouse.

796
01:04:08,054 --> 01:04:10,139
Th... The poorhouse?

797
01:04:10,598 --> 01:04:14,435
You're lying. It isn't true.
Tell me that you're lying!

798
01:04:14,602 --> 01:04:18,439
Did things not go according
to your plan, Lord Barkis?

799
01:04:18,606 --> 01:04:23,402
Well, perhaps in disappointment
we are perfectly matched.

800
01:04:42,213 --> 01:04:45,007
Be gone, ye demons from hell!

801
01:04:45,174 --> 01:04:49,262
Back to the void
from whence you came!

802
01:04:49,428 --> 01:04:51,222
You shall not enter here.

803
01:04:51,389 --> 01:04:53,975
Back, back!

804
01:04:54,141 --> 01:04:56,352
Keep it down, we're in a church.

805
01:04:56,519 --> 01:04:58,437
Evening.

806
01:05:34,932 --> 01:05:37,226
Dearly beloved and departed...

807
01:05:37,393 --> 01:05:43,107
we are gathered here today to join
this man and this corpse in marriage.

808
01:05:46,444 --> 01:05:48,821
- Victor?
- Shh!

809
01:05:50,364 --> 01:05:51,866
Living first.

810
01:05:53,909 --> 01:05:55,494
With this hand...

811
01:05:56,245 --> 01:05:58,748
I will lift your sorrows.

812
01:06:00,374 --> 01:06:02,627
Your cup will never empty...

813
01:06:03,169 --> 01:06:05,171
for I will be your wine.

814
01:06:06,047 --> 01:06:07,340
Now you.

815
01:06:12,511 --> 01:06:14,555
With this hand...

816
01:06:14,722 --> 01:06:17,058
I will lift your sorrows.

817
01:06:18,559 --> 01:06:21,729
Your cup will never empty.

818
01:06:23,481 --> 01:06:25,524
For I will be...

819
01:06:31,113 --> 01:06:32,823
I will be...

820
01:06:34,742 --> 01:06:36,369
Go on, my dear.

821
01:06:36,952 --> 01:06:38,746
Your cup...

822
01:06:39,413 --> 01:06:41,499
will never empty...

823
01:06:43,709 --> 01:06:45,628
for I will be...

824
01:06:47,755 --> 01:06:49,965
I will be your wine.

825
01:06:54,595 --> 01:06:56,222
She's having second thoughts.

826
01:06:59,308 --> 01:07:00,434
I can't.

827
01:07:01,102 --> 01:07:02,770
What's wrong?

828
01:07:04,105 --> 01:07:05,898
This is wrong.

829
01:07:07,108 --> 01:07:09,235
I was a bride.

830
01:07:09,694 --> 01:07:12,279
My dreams were taken from me.

831
01:07:13,114 --> 01:07:14,740
Well, now...

832
01:07:15,241 --> 01:07:18,285
Now I've stolen them
from someone else.

833
01:07:19,036 --> 01:07:21,539
I love you, Victor.

834
01:07:22,832 --> 01:07:25,209
But you're not mine.

835
01:07:30,589 --> 01:07:31,841
Victoria!

836
01:07:46,647 --> 01:07:49,817
Oh, how touching.

837
01:07:49,984 --> 01:07:52,778
I always cry at weddings.

838
01:07:54,071 --> 01:07:58,409
Our young lovers
together at last.

839
01:07:58,576 --> 01:08:02,538
Surely now they can live
happily ever after.

840
01:08:03,581 --> 01:08:05,207
But you forget...

841
01:08:05,416 --> 01:08:07,501
she's still my wife!

842
01:08:07,668 --> 01:08:10,337
I'll not leave
here empty-handed!

843
01:08:11,672 --> 01:08:12,840
You?

844
01:08:15,843 --> 01:08:17,261
Emily?

845
01:08:17,428 --> 01:08:18,637
You!

846
01:08:18,804 --> 01:08:21,807
But... But... I left you.

847
01:08:22,892 --> 01:08:23,976
For dead.

848
01:08:26,020 --> 01:08:27,381
This woman is obviously
delusional!

849
01:08:35,029 --> 01:08:38,324
Sorry to cut things short,
but we must be on our way.

850
01:08:38,491 --> 01:08:40,868
Take your hands off her.

851
01:08:41,869 --> 01:08:44,663
Do I have to kill you too?

852
01:08:46,040 --> 01:08:47,124
Aargh!

853
01:08:48,042 --> 01:08:51,045
Victor, catch!

854
01:08:51,712 --> 01:08:53,214
Sorry.

855
01:09:03,849 --> 01:09:05,726
<i>Ah, sacrebleu!</i>

856
01:09:07,812 --> 01:09:10,189
I say, you're not
playing fair, sir.

857
01:09:52,022 --> 01:09:53,941
Touché, my dear.

858
01:09:54,525 --> 01:09:55,860
Get out.

859
01:09:56,610 --> 01:09:59,405
Oh, I'm leaving.

860
01:10:03,909 --> 01:10:06,912
But first a toast. To Emily.

861
01:10:07,079 --> 01:10:11,500
Always the bridesmaid,
never the bride.

862
01:10:11,959 --> 01:10:13,627
Tell me, my dear...

863
01:10:13,794 --> 01:10:18,674
can a heart still break once
it's stopped beating? Hm?

864
01:10:20,885 --> 01:10:22,344
Let me at him!
Let me at him!

865
01:10:22,511 --> 01:10:24,096
- No, don't hold me back.
- Wait.

866
01:10:25,347 --> 01:10:27,975
We must abide by their rules.

867
01:10:28,142 --> 01:10:31,353
We are amongst the living.

868
01:10:31,520 --> 01:10:33,397
Well said.

869
01:10:38,652 --> 01:10:39,945
Ah!

870
01:10:49,330 --> 01:10:51,290
Not anymore.

871
01:10:54,835 --> 01:10:57,129
Yep, you're right.
He's all yours.

872
01:11:09,058 --> 01:11:11,143
New arrival.

873
01:11:17,816 --> 01:11:21,779
Oh, Victor, I never thought
I'd see you again.

874
01:11:29,119 --> 01:11:30,621
Wait.

875
01:11:31,372 --> 01:11:33,624
I made a promise.

876
01:11:36,335 --> 01:11:38,921
You kept your promise.

877
01:11:39,755 --> 01:11:41,715
You set me free.

878
01:11:52,559 --> 01:11:55,604
Now I can do the same for you.

879
01:17:05,205 --> 01:17:07,207
